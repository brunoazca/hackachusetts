# Kiro Work Log

This file is the record of what we did with Kiro.
Every chat and every agent adds a line here.
At the end, we read this file to write the Kiro usage story.

## Rules
- Add the newest entry at the TOP of the log below.
- Never delete old entries. Only add.
- One entry per real piece of work. Not for tiny no-op turns.
- Keep each line short and true.

## Entry format
```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <short title>
- Teammate: <name of the person who asked for this>
- Agent: <which Kiro agent did it>
- Did: <what changed or was decided>
- Why: <reason, one line>
- Where: <files touched, or "none">
- Idea: <any idea raised, or "none">
```

We are a team. Always name the teammate who drove the work AND the agent.
If the agent does not know the teammate's name, it asks before logging.
